# Demography-of-Inventors

A line graph to show the most common age group of inventors at the time of their inventions.

Process: 
1) List of inventions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions#Modern_era
2) Birthday of the inventors: click on the name of inventor from the above list, or if the inventor doesn't have a wikipedia page, google them. Sometimes however not enough info about the inventor is public knowledge, those are the "Unknown" cases.
3) Deduce age at the time of inventions by subtracting the birthday of the inventor from the year of invention
4) jot down the count for each age and then plot it

Suggestions and expansions hugely welcome :)
